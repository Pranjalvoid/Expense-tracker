The objective of this project is to develop a Python application that enables users to track and categorize their monthly expenses while assisting with budgeting. 

The app will allow users to input expense categories and amounts directly via the terminal. These expense entries will be appended to a file for storage. The application will then read the file to provide a summary of the total expenses for the month.
